# Virtual Mouse-OpenCV
 It is a mouse simulation system which performs all the functions performed by your mouse corresponding to your hand movements and gestures. Simply speaking, a camera captures your video and depending on your hand gestures, you can move the cursor and perform left click, right click, drag, select and scroll up and down. The predefined gestures make use of only three fingers marked by different colours.
